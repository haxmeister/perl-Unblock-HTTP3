=head1 NAME

Unblock::HTTP3::NativeABI - native consumer ABI for Unblock::HTTP3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exposes the optional native consumer ABI for XS event frameworks
and HTTP libraries.

The ordinary Perl API remains the portable interface. A native integration can
keep one persistent context for an exact L<Unblock::HTTP3::Client> or
L<Unblock::HTTP3::Server> and avoid repeated Perl method lookup on the common
connection and transaction path.

The ABI does not expose libnghttp3 structures or take ownership of the QUIC
transport.

=head1 DISCOVERY

    my $definition = Unblock::HTTP3::NativeABI::definition();

The returned hash contains:

    provider
    abi_version
    struct_size
    operations_address

C<provider> keeps the XS provider loaded and can be called again to obtain the
current operations address.

Consumers must check both C<abi_version> and C<struct_size> before
dereferencing operations.

=head1 HEADER

The installed header is:

    Unblock/HTTP3/NativeABI/unblock_http3_consumer.h

Its include directory is available through:

    Unblock::HTTP3::NativeABI::native_include_dir()

The complete installed path is available through:

    Unblock::HTTP3::NativeABI::header_path()

C<c_header()> returns the same header text for build systems that prefer to
generate a private copy.

=head1 ABI VERSION 1

ABI version 1 accepts exact C<Unblock::HTTP3::Client>,
C<Unblock::HTTP3::Server>, and C<Unblock::HTTP3::Transaction> objects.
Subclasses and adapters use the portable Perl API.

It provides native operations to:

    create and destroy a Client or Server context
    service the Client or Server
    submit a normal client request
    poll ready Transactions
    poll informational responses
    inspect Transaction Request and Response objects
    inspect Transaction stream ID and state
    send normal and informational server responses
    inspect connection failure state

Callback configuration and advanced body objects remain on the portable Perl
API.

=head1 OWNERSHIP

C<request()>, C<next_transaction()>, C<next_informational()>, and
C<transaction_next_informational()> return owned SV pointers with one caller
reference. The consumer must mortalize or decrement them.

C<transaction_request()>, C<transaction_response()>, and C<error()> return
borrowed SV pointers. They remain valid only while the owning object remains
alive and unchanged.

C<request()> returns NULL when the normal request path returns undef, including
temporary QUIC stream-credit backpressure. Poll operations return NULL when no
item is ready. C<transaction_response()> returns NULL until a response exists.

Canonical Request and Response objects may be inspected with the
Uniform::HTTP 0.06 native FastPath.

=head1 THREADS

Create one ABI context per Perl interpreter. Do not share a context across
ithreads. Create a fresh context after an interpreter clone.

=head1 FALLBACK

The native ABI is an optimization. Consumers that cannot use ABI version 1
should continue to use the ordinary Perl API.
